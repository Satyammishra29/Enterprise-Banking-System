javac -cp "lib/*" --module-path "path/to/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -sourcepath src -d out src/Main.java src/model/*.java src/model/auth/*.java src/model/banking/*.java src/dao/*.java src/util/*.java src/controller/auth/*.java src/controller/banking/*.java src/controller/dashboard/*.java

# Test database connectivity
java -cp "lib/*;out" util.DatabaseTest

# Run the application
cd out
java -cp "..\lib\*;." --module-path "path/to/javafx-sdk/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml Main
```
